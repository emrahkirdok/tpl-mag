"Analyzing Ancient DNA through DNA Concatenation Methods"

This study aims to analyze ancient DNA samples using DNA assembly methods without the use of a reference genome. The objective of this research is to enhance the accuracy of ancient DNA analyses, enabling the retrieval of precise results from genetic material of the past. Furthermore, through a comprehensive comparison with reference-based methods using the same samples, we intend to evaluate the outcomes of these two distinct approaches. These comparisons will contribute to a deeper understanding of the reliability and sensitivity of ancient DNA analyses, thereby advancing our capacity to access genetic information from ancient eras.
