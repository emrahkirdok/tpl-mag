"Analyzing Ancient DNA through DNA Concatenation Methods"

This study aims to analyze ancient DNA samples using DNA assembly methods without the use of a reference genome. This research, which aims to improve the accuracy of ancient DNA analyses, seeks to enable the retrieval of precise results from genetic material of the past. Additionally, by comparing the same samples with reference-based methods, we will comprehensively assess the results of these two different approaches. These comparisons will deepen our understanding of the reliability and sensitivity of ancient DNA analyses and enhance our potential to access genetic information from ancient eras
